The Financial Times says Rachel Reeves will use her Mansion House speech tomorrow to tear up "financial red tape which makes the UK uncompetitive", but will resist pressure to loosen her fiscal rules.

The former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert tells the Guardian that a proposed humanitarian city in Rafah would, in fact, be a "concentration camp". Israeli ministers back the plan to move all Palestinians into the site, but Olmert says it would amount to ethnic cleansing. Israel has denied allegations of war crimes in Gaza. Olmert says not all international criticism can be dismissed as antisemitism, saying "normal people" now believe Israel has "crossed every possible line".

A Royal source tells the Daily Mirror that the King backed what's been called a "peace summit" with aides to Prince Harry. The talks are described as a "significant step" - but the source says King Charles wants public criticism of the family to stop if there is to be a "way forward".
